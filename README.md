# DeepHammy - Deep Learning Virtual Hamster
Meet Hammy, a hamster with a DQN-for-brains. Watch him live his hamster life at insane speeds, and then watch him be reincarnated to do it all over again. Help him out when he is in need, or maybe get him addicited to hamsternip if you are feeling evil.


## Features
- Hammy has a set of physical and psychological needs which must be met in order for him to survive. For example, if Hammy eats too much food in too short a term or too little, it will prove to be his undoing.
- TODO: Speed the game up to watch hammy quickly live and learn, or slow the game down to interact with him
- TODO: Hammy can develop an emotional response if you interact with him. Beware, because he can become dependent on your interactions, going into fits of depression or rage when he does not get what he wants. This will have a real impact on the game, including abstaining from eating, smashing his stuff, or never sleeping.
